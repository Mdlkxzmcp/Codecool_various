# Calc v.less, Calc v.more & Calclamb

The files calcl.py & calcm.py are small projects for Codecool. Calc v.more was created first and contains all the comments, Calc v.less is the almost totally basic version of a calculator so I figured that no comments are needed. Calcamb.py is a lambda implemented version made just for fun
